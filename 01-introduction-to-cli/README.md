# 🐧  Day 1 Completed

> “If you think Linux is Ubuntu… we need to talk.”

Today I stopped memorizing Linux commands  
And started understanding what’s happening under the hood.

No shortcuts. No blind memorization.

Understand → Practice → Break → Fix → Repeat.

# 🧠 — WHAT IS LINUX REALLY?

Before touching commands, understand what you are controlling.

Linux is:

- ❌ Not Ubuntu  
- ❌ Not a Terminal  
- ❌ Not a Desktop  
- ❌ Not the full OS  

Linux **is the Kernel.**

Definition:
Linux is a kernel that manages hardware resources and provides core system services like process management, memory management, filesystem control, networking, and security.

Without the kernel, nothing works.

# 🧩 What Is a Kernel?

The Kernel:

- Manages CPU scheduling  
- Manages memory (RAM)  
- Controls disk & filesystems  
- Handles device drivers  
- Manages processes  
- Enforces permissions  
- Handles networking  

Everything runs on top of it.
